# WCalPackage
This package contains a few programs to study electronic properties based on the Wannier tight-binding model.

## TBHmftn
This program will convert the case_hr.dat generated from the wannier90 to a packed file named ftn58sparse.mat.

### CalPDOS 
A sub-program to help analyzing the orbital weight on each states. 

## STBHmftn
This program can create a finite slab tight-binding model with the (hkl) surface from the bulk tight-binding model.

## GreenSur
This program can calculate the surface states on a semi-inifite thin film by using the Green's function method.

## MirrorChern
The program to calculate the mirror Chern number (Mxy) in SnTe.

## SuperCell
The program can generate an arbitrary supercell from a TB model with new unit vectors constructed from the linear combination of the original unit vecotrs. 

### Unfold
A sub-program to calculate unfolding band structure

## WilsonLoop
