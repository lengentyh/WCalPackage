# semi-infiniteGreen
A more general version of GreenSur originally written by Chang, Tay-Rong
By setting input parameters in ```brick_auto_v2.m```, it is possible to generate the spectrum of 1D edge state from a 2D system
The principle is the same to GreenSur, and the variable names are very similar to GreenSur, too.
